# 🏮 Lantern — gadd state ledger

Live state snapshot for work on gadd itself. Read at session start; update before ending
a session or handing off context. This file is only ever NOW — history lives in the log
below (append-only) and in git.

## Current state

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | v0.1 + RED_TEAM bench de-collapse (2026-07-14, uncommitted) |
| Adapters | lv (boundary) shipped · cc (in-loop) shipped — blocking CI/hooks pending |
| RED_TEAM | Bench split into `RED_TEAM/` — one definition file per adversary (role, attack surface, pass criteria, output contract) + `gate-matrix.md`. Gate runners dispatch each adversary as its OWN isolated invocation, in parallel (cc: five `gadd-rt-*` subagents; lv: five independent API calls). Adversaries never see each other's verdicts. Models: structural (CONTRACT_FIDELITY, TEST_HONESTY) → cheap tier (haiku); judgment (SECURITY, DATA_INTEGRITY, REGRESSION) → strong tier (opus) |
| Protocol invariants | VERDICT + max 3 blockers per adversary · re-run only failed adversaries on the new diff · 3-round cap · Architect arbitrates at the cap |
| Graders | `RED_TEAM/**` is grader territory — executors and the Fixer never edit it |
| Roadmap next | `gadd-accept` bot · cc blocking CI/hooks · Cursor/Replit adapters |

## Log (append-only, newest first)

- **2026-07-14 · v0.2 item 3 (C1 closed):** ratified sentence added to spec invariant 3 —
  "Acceptance is decided only by deterministic gates; RED_TEAM verdicts gate dispatch of
  repair work in-loop, never acceptance." `gadd-loop.md` steps 4/7, `gate-matrix.md`
  protocol 3, and `gadd-redteam.yml` aligned to repair-dispatch semantics.

- **2026-07-14 · Architect deep audit (read-only):** full-repo goal reconstruction +
  objective-function proposal written to `audits/objective-audit-v1.md` (committed). Verdict:
  goal clear in function, unratified in audience; North Star (escaped-regression rate)
  UNMEASURED; 6 contradictions tabled (C1 LLM-verdict philosophy split is the deepest);
  secrets scan clean. Nothing modified beyond the report + this log line. NEXT: ratification
  conversation — 8 open questions in report §6; action plan §5 proposed, not executed.
- **2026-07-14 · RED_TEAM de-collapse:** v0.1 shipped `adapters/cc/agents/gadd-redteam.md`
  as ONE agent role-playing the 5-adversary bench (lv's `redteam.sh` had the same collapse
  in a single prompt), contradicting spec §3 "adversaries in parallel". Split into
  `RED_TEAM/` per-adversary definitions + isolated parallel dispatch in both adapters,
  models mapped per the Phase 0 orchestration (structural→cheap, judgment→strong). The
  ambiguity is closed in spec §3 (independence is now a spec concern); lesson logged in
  `docs/rejection-ledger.md`.
- **2026-07-11 · v0.1:** spec + lv adapter + cc adapter (`f66d686`).
